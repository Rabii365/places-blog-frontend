# Places App

## Overview
Places App is a web application built using React for the frontend and Node.js with Express.js for the backend. This application allows users to sign up and log in with their email, password, and profile image. Once logged in, users can add places with a title, description, image, and address. The address is handled by the Google Maps API to be shown in an interactive map.
